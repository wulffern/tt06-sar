# Tiny Tapeout Analog Project Template

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Analog projects

For specifications and instructions, see the [analog specs page](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/analog/).

*Note*: Analog designs are currently in beta. There's a small chance that the changes will change before the deadline for Tiny Tapeout 6, or that we will have to postpone the analog design support to a future shuttle. If you have any questions, please join the [Tiny Tapeout Discord](https://tinytapeout.com/discord) and ask in the #analog channel.
